### START READING HERE

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For the purposes of homework, we strongly recommend you
produce a PDF document (not Word, not HTML). R Markdown also lets you easily
incorporate R code and it's accompanying output inside your document.
There's no need to copy/paste R text output or to export/import R plots.  

If you want more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>,
but pretty much everything you would need to know is exemplified in the document
you are reading right now.

You are only required to use R Markdown for HW1.  

For HW2 and beyond, choose your own process: perhaps
R Markdown, or LaTeX (possibly with knitr for R), 
or Word (copy/paste R output and export/import plots), or other?

No matter your process, the final result must be a single PDF file with 
all the exercises in order and submitted online in Canvas.


### INSTRUCTIONS:

Right now, before making any changes to this document, 
open it in RStudio and compile ("knit") the document.
To compile ("knit"), just click the **Knit** button in 
RStudio and choose "Knit to PDF".

We just want to make sure your R environment is set up correctly
before you start making changes to the file.

If you are working online at rstudio.uchicago.edu, all should work.
If you are using your own computer, you must install R, Rstudio,
and TeX (LaTeX).  Follow the instructions here:    
[http://statistics.uchicago.edu/~collins/Rinstall](http://statistics.uchicago.edu/~collins/Rinstall).

When you click the **Knit** button in RStudio, 
a document will be generated that includes both content
(these words) as well as the textual output and plots from 
any  embedded R code "chunks" within the document. 

### STOP HERE IF YOU CAN'T OUTPUT A PDF DOC

### ASK FOR HELP ON PIAZZA OR AT OFFICE HOURS

Remember, if you are using your own computer rather
than rstudio.uchicago.edu, then you must install updated 
versions of R, RStudio, **and TeX (LaTeX)**.

# Q1

### INSTRUCTIONS:
Complete HW1, Question 1.

Below (inside this .Rmd source file)
is code that displays my `HWpolicies.pdf` file from Question 1.
You should replace the file `HWpolicies.pdf` in your HW1 
folder with your Question 1 PDF file using the same name: `HWpolicies.pdf`.
Then, your PDF will display below instead of mine.

\includegraphics[height=3in, angle=0]{HWpolicies.pdf}

If your PDF displays sideways or upsidedown,  experiment 
with the `angle` option (`90`, `180`, or `-90`) to fix this.
If your graphic appears huge or too small to read, 
experiment with the `height` option.

#### CAUTION: If you choose to "Knit to Word"...
This graphic will not appear in your Word doc.   
You will have to manually import `HWpolicies.pdf` into your Word document.

# Q6

This is Question 6 on the HW1 assignment.
At the end of this document, we explain how you can
append Questions 2, 3, 4, and 5 to the end to complete HW1.

Yes, it is OK for HW1 that your work will be in the 
following order: Questions 1, 6, 2, 3, 4, 5.

## (a) Some basics of R Markdown

### INSTRUCTIONS:

Read the original document (this .Rmd file) to see which R
code is displayed along with the output and which R code is
not displayed  in the compiled Word or PDF document.  Be sure you
understand how to suppress display of R code (unless
specifically asked to show R code in an exercise).

```{r}
mydata <- read.csv("http://statistics.uchicago.edu/~collins/stat234/data/sevengr.csv")
glimpse(mydata)
head(mydata)
```
Notice that only the output (not the R code) of this R chunk is displayed.
This is because we set the "chunk option" `echo=FALSE` at the start of 
this document. This suppresess display of R code for every R chunk 
(unless you override this by specifying `echo=TRUE` in the R chunk).

## (b) Numerical summaries

```{r echo=TRUE}
aggregate(mydata[3:4], list(mydata$Gender), mean)
```

Notice that the R code is displayed now because I set
the option `echo=TRUE` just for this R code chunk.
Generally, you should not display R code unless the 
homework exercise specifically asks you to do so.
To make this easy for you, I set `echo=FALSE` as the default
at the start of this document and you can just start 
HW2, HW3, HW4, etc.\ documents by copying this HW1 document
as a starting point.

### INSTRUCTIONS:

Write an R code chunk here to display the median IQ by gender.
Do not display the R code, just the results.
```{r}
summaryBy(IQ~Gender=="F", data=mydata, FUN = median)
```

## (c) Saving and printing values

```{r echo=TRUE}
x <- 20
```

I chose to set `echo=TRUE` to display the R code above for transparency.
Since the variable `x` is assigned a value, I can refer to 
that value inside my document like this: `x` = `r x`.

Look inside this .Rmd file and you will see 
that I did not type in the number 20 in the previous sentence, 
instead I referred to the value
stored in `x` within R, which is... `r x`.

If the value of `x` changes later in the document 
and I refer to the value after that,
then the new value will correctly display and I don't 
have to remember what the value is (or was) while I'm typing.

```{r}
x <- 15
```

The value of `x` has now changed to `r x`.

```{r}
x <- 17
```

...and now, `x` = `r x`.


### INSTRUCTIONS:

Set up an R code chunk here to assign the value $\sqrt{3}$ 
to a variable called `y`.
Do not get out a calculator.
Let R do the calculation for you in the code.

**Please display your R code for this part.**

### INSERT R CODE CHUNK HERE TO ASSIGN SQRT(3) TO VARIABLE y

```{r}
y = 3**(0.5)
print(y)
print(x*y)
```


Then, replace both blanks below by entering code that uses 
references to `x` and `y` to display what value is 
assigned to variable `y` and the value of the product (`x * y`).

Do **NOT** get out a calculator and then type in the values yourself.
Instead, let R and R Markdown do all the work.
Just refer to the values by their variable names: `x` and `y`.

**HINT:** Above, I displayed the value of `x` like this: 
The value of `x` is `r x`.    
Also, multiplication in R uses the `*` operator.

We assigned the number ___1.732___  to the variable `y`.

The product of `x` and `y` is ___29.44___.

## (d) Including and Sizing R Graphs/Plots

When you compile this .Rmd document, you will see that
the plots below are much too small; not useful or legible.

### INSTRUCTIONS:

Change the code chunk options for `fig.width` and `fig.height` 
and the `ncol` option in the `grid.arrange` function
to display a 2-by-2 grid of plots that fills the width of the page.
Just fill the page width by eye, not by some calculation of page width.
Also, each of the four plots should be nearer to square in shape
(avoid plots that are really tall, narrow rectangles or really short, wide rectangles).


```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=10}
p1 <- gf_histogram(~ IQ, data = mydata, color = "white", bins = 15)
p2 <- gf_boxplot(IQ ~ Gender, data = mydata)
p3 <- gf_point(GPA ~ IQ | Gender, data = mydata)
p4 <- gf_point(GPA ~ IQ, color = ~Gender, data = mydata)
grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, p4, ncol=2)
```

## (e) Including and Sizing scanned and cropped PDF graphics

### INSTRUCTIONS:

Change the `height` of the 
cropped PDF below as needed for better appearance. 

\includegraphics[height=6in, angle=0]{graphic1.pdf}

#### CAUTION: If you choose to "Knit to Word"...
This graphic will not appear in your Word doc.   
You will have to manually import `graphic1.pdf` into your Word document.

## INSTRUCTIONS:

Please fix the display of pdf `graphic2.pdf` below.
I must have used the CamScanner app with my phone turned sideways!
You many need to change both the
`height` and `angle` for a better display.

\includegraphics[height=6in, angle=90]{graphic2.pdf}

#### CAUTION: If you choose to "Knit to Word"...
This graphic will not appear in your Word doc.   
You will have to first open the file `graphic2.pdf` and rotate it,
save it, then manually import it into your Word document.


## (f) Including and scanned PDF multi-page files

First, we demonstrate how to bring in all pages a multi-page PDF file:

#### CAUTION: If you choose to "Knit to Word"...
None of the pdf pages of `multipage.pdf` will appear in your document.


Now, we demonstrate bringing in just a subset of the pages of a multi-page PDF file.   
In this case we include only pages 3 and 4.

#### CAUTION: If you choose to "Knit to Word"...
The two pdf pages (3--4) in `multipage.pdf` will not appear in your document.

## INSTRUCTIONS:

  1. Now you write one command modeled after the two above, but 
  include only pages 2 and 4 of the 4-page PDF called `multipage.pdf`.

  For help, see the bottom of page 2 
  in the LaTeX documentation about `\includepdf` at   
  [http://ctan.math.utah.edu/ctan/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/pdfpages/pdfpages.pdf](http://ctan.math.utah.edu/ctan/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/pdfpages/pdfpages.pdf)
 
\includepdf[pages={2}, width=!, height=!, angle=0]{multipage.pdf}
\includepdf[pages={4}, width=!, height=!, angle=0]{multipage.pdf}
 
  2. Delete the two commands above that bring in all 4 pages of
  `multipage.pdf` and then pages 3--4 of `multipage.pdf`.
  In the end, you should have one command that includes only
  pages 2 and 4 of `multipage.pdf`.

#### CAUTION: If you choose to "Knit to Word"...
The two pdf pages 2 and 4 in `multipage.pdf` will not appear in your document.
You will have to append them to your document later, after you save
your Word file as a PDF file (use workflow option 3 or 4 below).

# INSTRUCTIONS: THE LAST STEP

# Incorporate Questions 2, 3, 4, and 5 into This Document

At this point, you have completed Q1 and Q6 within this document
and the result after compiling ("Knit to PDF") 
should be a document about 11--12 pages long
(two of these pages are pages 2 and 4 of `multipage.pdf`).
Now, you need to append your answers to Q2--Q5 to this PDF document.

You have several choices for completing the rest of HW1 by
combining everything above plus placing Q2---Q5 at the end to create a 
single PDF document that includes Questions 1, 6, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

Yes, I realize that Question 6 will be out of order.
That's the easiest order for HW1, so we recommend it.

Here are a few options I can think of to combine
Q1 and Q6 with Q2--Q5 into a single PDF file.

  1. Continue using R Markdown and type 
  in your answers to Q2--Q5 using regular text and LaTeX 
  commands    ...like this: I found the $z$-score as
  $$z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}$$
  
  2. Handwrite your answers to Q2--Q5, scan them into a single PDF file 
  (or several cropped PDFs),  and incorporate the PDF(s) into 
  this R Markdown document just as in Q6 parts (e) and/or (f) above.
  
  3. Compile this R Markdown file to Word (instead of a PDF) and
  continue that Word document by writing your answers to Q2--Q5 in Word.    
  Remember, you will have to go back and manually insert all the
  other graphs into your finished product: `HWpolicies.pdf`, `graphic1.pdf`,
  `graphic2.pdf`, and pages 2 and 4 of `multipage.pdf`.
  When finished, save the Word document as a PDF file to submit.
  
  4. Compile this R Markdown file to Word (instead of a PDF), 
  handwrite your answers to Q2--Q5, scan to PDF, and
  import the PDF into Word.  
  Remember, you will have to go back and manually insert all the
  other graphs into your finished product: `HWpolicies.pdf`, `graphic1.pdf`,
  `graphic2.pdf`, and pages 2 and 4 of `multipage.pdf`.
  
  5. Compile this R Markdown file to PDF.  
  Handwrite your answers to Q2--Q5 and scan to PDF.
  Combine the two PDFs into one using, for example, 
  the Preview app on a Mac.
  
  6. Compile this file to PDF and write your answers to 
  Q2--Q5 in a separate LaTeX file. Compile the LaTeX file to PDF 
  and combine the two PDFs however you prefer.
